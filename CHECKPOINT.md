## Summary of Progress

We have successfully debugged and stabilized the `src/kdiff` script, achieving a functional state for its primary use cases.

### Completed Items:
- **Bug Fixes:**
    - **Call Detection:** The logic to distinguish between interactive and internal `kubectl`/`argocd` calls was improved to be more robust by inspecting arguments rather than relying on TTY detection (Commit `4eefebf`).
    - **Staging Directory Cleanup:** A bug that caused temporary staging directories to be left behind was fixed by implementing a centralized cleanup trap (Commit `9aa0da6`).
    - **`yq` Quoting:** Ensured `yq` expressions are quoted correctly when generating runtime transform scripts (Commit `8e476a5`).
    - **Preset Handling:** The most critical bug was fixed in the `handle_interactive_call` function. The script now correctly uses a user-specified `--preset` instead of incorrectly creating a new, empty runtime preset. This allows pre-configured presets to work as intended.

- **Testing:**
    - The `test/interactive-flow.sh` script was updated to reflect the latest code changes and is now passing, validating the interactive workflow.

- **Features:**
    - A default preset has been created at `presets/default` which includes a `transform` script to remove common Kubernetes clutter and a `compare` script using `diff -u -N`.

### Current Status
The `kdiff` script is now considered functional. It can be invoked interactively with ad-hoc transformations (e.g., `--yq`) or with pre-configured presets (e.g., `--preset ./presets/default`), and it correctly sets up the environment for the internal `kubectl diff` call.

### Next Steps
The user will draft the next steps. A `TODO.md` file has been created to track the planned migration of the test suite to the Bats testing framework for improved structure and maintainability.
